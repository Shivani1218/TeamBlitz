      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">Stay in touch with your child’s school.
Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.
Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.
Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group.
The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.
Look for ways to make learning fun.
