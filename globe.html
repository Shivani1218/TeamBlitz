    <h1 class="display-4">Global Impact</h1>
    <p >Dealing with the unforeseen challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people all across the world.
       Medical News Today has spoken with people from different countries, asking how the pandemic has impacted their lives.
</p>
<p>The entire world is buzzing with uncertainty and questions: How long will the pandemic last? What will people’s lives look like once the pandemic is over?</p>
<p>At the moment, many countries have taken measures — some of them stringent — to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. While some of these countries are now considering whether to ease the measures, others have already decided to keep them in place over the following weeks.
  Cross border movements have been put to pause. However, these lockdowns are also pushing major economies to the brick.</p></div>

  <h2 class="antic"><b>Impact of the pandemic on global economy</b></h2>
  <p>The pandemic has pushed the global economy into a recession, which means the economy starts shrinking and growth stops.</p>
  <p>In the US, Covid-19-related disruptions have led to millions filing for unemployment benefits. In April alone, the figures were at 20.5 million, and are expected to rise as the impact of the pandemic on the US labour market worsens. As per a Reuters
    report, since March 21, more than 36 million have filed for unemployment benefits, which is almost a quarter of the working-age population.</p>
<p>Further, an early analysis by IMF reveals that the manufacturing output in many countries has gone done, which reflects a fall in external demand and growing expectations of a fall in domestic demand.</p>

<h2 class="antic"><b>How have countries coped?</b></h2>
<p>According to an assessment by the World Economic Forum (WEF), supporting SMEs and larger businesses is crucial for maintaining employment and financial stability.

In India, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced some details of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, to provide relief to Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) in the form of an increase in credit guarantees.</p>

<p>Many advanced economies in the world have rolled out support packages. While India’s economic stimulus package is 10 per cent of its GDP, Japan’s is 21.1 per cent, followed by the US (13 per cent), Sweden (12 per cent), Germany (10.7 per cent), France (9.3 per cent), Spain (7.3 per cent) and Italy (5.7 per cent).

However, the WEF notes, “…there is concern that the size of packages may prove insufficient for the duration of the crisis; that disbursement may be slower than is needed; that not all firms in need would be targeted; and that such programmes may be overly reliant on debt financing.”</p>

<p>In Asia, countries including India, China, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea account for about 85 per cent of all the Covid-19 cases on the continent.</p>
